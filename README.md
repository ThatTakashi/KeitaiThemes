# KeitaiThemes
This here is a repository of themes for Japanese android based flip phones (keitai). These themes are free to use and are designed for use with Total Launcher.

Community discord server (the amazing people there are to thank for encouraging me to make these!: https://discord.com/invite/BfT3KKMS4w

## How to setup the themes
Setting up the themes on a keitai is a rather easy process provided you have access to a computer. I have put together a video tutorial avaliable [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXR82QfdmoU) that should help you get started. Most of these themes consist of an apps page along side a main homescreen with the likes of a clock or something similar.

If you need any help setting up the themes, head on over to the community discord server and I'd be glad to help :D

## Contributing
I would love these themes to be used as a template for you to make your own themes. I know the community srounding Japanese keitai if a very creative group of people so I'd love to see how you express yourself through your keitai's homescreen be that retro, anime, or even just based on a person/place. 

You may contribute to this repo by submitting a pull request containing a folder with all the images for your theme or alternativly message me (@thattakashi) on discord and I'll be more than happy to add it to the repo!

## Misc
I'll be updating this repo semi-regularly with new themes as I create them (please note that any theme folder with "WIP" in the name means the I or the person making the theme is still working on it and it's current state should not be assumed as complete.
